Hi! My name is Eli Stoll. I'm a 2023 graduate from Washington State University with a B.S in Computer Science
and a minor in mathematics. I currently live in North California with my friends and roommates. I worked for 3 years for Inland Fiber Networks writing backend Node.JS microservices, though I was laid off in May 2025 due to budget restrictions. I'm currently looking for work, if you're hiring and like my work, feel free to email me <a href="mailto:weedleeedle@gmail.com">here</a>.
