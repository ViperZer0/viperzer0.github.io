## Professional Expereince
### Inland Fiber Networks
*From May 2023 to May 2025*

At Inland Fiber Networks I primarily worked in TypeScript with Node.JS and Express
to build APIs to automate the processes of activating new customers and configuring their routers
and devices. One project I'm especially proud of is a Rust script to automate the process of upgrading hundreds of routers in an apartment complex based on details provided via CSV. The Rust application used Tokio and Serde, and made use of techniques such as periodic polling, exponential backoff, and errors-as-values error handling.

## Education
Bachelor of Science Computer Science. Minor in Mathematics

**Washington State University**, 2023. 3.98 GPA

## Coursework
### Software Design Project
**Tools Used:** ASP.NET, EF Core, SQL Server, Agile, C#

Worked in a team of 2 to develop a web-based data entry application for a local publishing company. Our application was built in C# using ASP.NET, EF
Core, and SQL Server. We used Agile practices, including monthly sprints and weekly meetings with clients to assess and manage project progress.
I built a full-stack module in C# to allow batch exporting data to Excel using reflection.

### Software Design & Architecture
**Tools Used:** C#, MonoGame, MVC Architecture, OOP Design Patterns

We created a “manic shooter” style game using C# and MonoGame with MVC
architecture as a team of 5 people. I built a robust scheduling
system for coding complex enemy and bullet patterns using object-oriented principles, including the Command and Builder patterns.

### Systems Programming C/C++
**Tools Used:** Linux, C, Systems Programming

We designed and recreated a virtual Linux filesystem and primitive kernel in C as a team of 2. Features included custom implementations of common Linux libc operations (such as open, mkdir) as well as GNU utilities (such as cat, cd). Additionally supported permissions, privilege escalation, and multiple
running processes.
